# Design of synthetic promoters for cyanobacteria with generative deep-learning model

In this research, we generated synthetic promoter sequence of cyanobactera(Synechocystis sp.PCC6803) and predicted their promoter strength. We generated 
newly synthetized promoter seqeunce via variational autoencoder(VAE), which is one of the popular deep-generative model. After synthetic promoter generation, we predicted their gene expression level through convolutional neural network. Using these deep-learning model, we can generate the synthetic promoter that has the valid features of the native promoter and predict their promoter strength without time-consuming experiments.
