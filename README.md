# Overview of this research

In this research, we generated synthetic promoter sequence of cyanobactera(Synechocystis sp.PCC6803) and predicted their promoter strength. We generated 
newly synthetized promoter seqeunce via variational autoencoder(VAE), which is one of the popular deep-generative model. After synthetic promoter generation, we predicted their gene expression level through convolutional neural network. Using these deep-learning model, we can generate the synthetic promoter that has the valid features of the native promoter and predict their promoter strength without time-consuming experiments.

# Promoter data mining

We uploaded code for promoter data mining. We used whole-genome sequence and differential-RNA sequencing results from Kopf et al., which are available at [link]. Through this code, user can be obtain the promoters whose lengths are 100 base pairs and their promoter strengts.  

# VAE model traninig and result evaluation

We uploaded code for tranining VAE model. We used whole-genome sequence and differential-RNA sequencing results from Kopf et al., which are available at [link]. Through this code, user can be obtain the promoters whose lengths are 100 base pairs and their promoter strengts.
